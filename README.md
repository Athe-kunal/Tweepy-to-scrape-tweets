# Tweepy-to-scrape-tweets

Twitter data is useful in analysis. Scraping twitter data using tweepy helps us in doing so. This scraper scrapes date from twitter between two dates. But there is rate limit to this. The maximum total number of Tweets available on a timeline is 3200 Tweets, backwards from now. You can make requests of up to 200 Tweets per request. You can make up to 900 requests per 15 minute window. There is an overall cap of 100,000 calls in a 24 hour period. You need to use full archive search.
